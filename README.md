<b>"This tutorial provides code examples on how to build your ML system available with REST API.<br>
In this tutorial, for building the ML service we will use Python 3.6 and Django 2.2.4.<br>
This tutorial is the first part that covers the basics which should be enough to build your ML system which:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>
can handle many API endpoints,</li>
<li>
each API endpoint can have several ML algorithms with different versions,</li>
<li>
ML code and artifacts (files with ML parameters) are stored in the code repository (git),</li>
<li>
supports fast deployments and continuous integration (tests for both: server and ML code),</li>
<li>
supports monitoring and algorithm diagnostic (support A/B tests),</li>
<li>
is scalable (deployed with containers), --[ not implemented in this version ]--</li>
<li>
has a user interface."</li></ul><br>
